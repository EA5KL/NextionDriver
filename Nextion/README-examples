Nextion Display Layout Examples
===============================

The examples in this directory give some ideas of what can be done.

They all need MMDVMHost screenLayout 3 or 4
With this layout, MMDVMHost activates the click event of S0 on the
active page to start user code on your display.


NX4832T035-L3-ND.HMI
--------------------
pressing on the logo on the main screen activates page 'system' 
where some buttons are defined: 
	* start & stop MMDVMHost
	* get the date from the host and display it
	* send a command wit and without parameters to NextionDriver

On the DMR page
	* upon receiving the TA, TA length and colour are changed 
	* when GPS data are received, these are showed in the middle of
		the screen and prepended with the slot number from where
		these coordinates came.
	NOTE: receiving GPS data is not yet implemented in the main code,
			so it requires a patched MMDVMHost.

		
NX4832T035-L3-ND-HotSpot-1.HMI
------------------------------
pressing on the logo on the main screen activates page 'system' 

The main screen has a processor load bar that is green when load<80
and orange when >80
CPU temperature, frequency and the load in numbers are displayed
The RX freq. is displayed
The location as set in MMDVM.ini is displayed


NX4832T035-L3-ND-HotSpot-2.HMI
------------------------------
pressing on the logo on the main screen activates page 'system' 
On the system page, you can
	* start & stop MMDVMHost
	* Reboot or poweroff the host
	* Set the display baudrate at 9600 or 115200
	* set the alternate speed (see below)
	
The main page alternates with the 'info' page, 
the information of the main page of example NX4832T035-L3-ND-HotSpot-2
is divided over the main page and the info page.

DMR page is somewhat changed (slot 1 info removed) and wrap of GPS
data is demonstrated


NX4832T035-L3-ND-HotSpot-3.HMI
------------------------------
pressing on the logo on the main screen activates page 'system' 
On the system page, you can
	* start & stop MMDVMHost
	* Reboot or poweroff the host
	* Set the display baudrate at 9600 or 115200
	* set the alternate speed (see below)
	
The main page alternates with the 'info' page,

On the DMR page, more info about the user is shown (Call, name, city, country)
This requires the DMR Id Lookup in the MMDVM.ini file to be OFF !
In the [DMR Id Lookup] section , be sure to comment the line with the
location of the DMRIds.dat file, for example :
#File=/opt/MMDVMHost/DMRIds.dat

and you have to place a file 'stripped.csv' (the same as used for md380tools)
in the directory of the NextionDriver program.


NX4832T035-L3-ND-HotSpot-4.HMI
------------------------------
Same functionality as above, but as extra: 
On the DMR screen, the current *and* the previous user are displayed
  This is done by copying the data from the ID/TA field to these
   fields at call end.
