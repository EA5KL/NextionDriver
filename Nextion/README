Nextion Display Layout for NextionDriver
========================================

When you use NextionDriver without modifications you already can make
a layout with buttons. Make the Touch Release Event with following code:

* when there is a command
    printh 2A
    printh F0
    printh <linux command>
    printh FF
    printh FF
    printh FF

the 'linux command' is executed
This could be, for example, 'service mmdvmhost stop' or 'service mmdvmhost start'


* When there is a command
    printh 2A
    printh F1
    printh <linux command>
    printh FF
    printh FF
    printh FF

the 'linux command' is executed and the __FIRST__ line of the result
is sent to the display variable 'msg'

There is an example HMI file included.
Press on the MMDVM logo on the main screen to go to the 'system' page
