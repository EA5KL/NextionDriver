Nextion Display Layout for NextionDriver
========================================

When you use NextionDriver without modifications you already can make
a layout with buttons. Make the Touch Release Event with following code:

* when there is a command
    printh 2A
    printh F0
    printh <linux command>
    printh FF
    printh FF
    printh FF

the 'linux command' is executed
This could be, for example, 'service mmdvmhost stop' or 'service mmdvmhost start'


* When there is a command
    printh 2A
    printh F1
    printh <linux command>
    printh FF
    printh FF
    printh FF

the 'linux command' is executed and the __FIRST__ line of the result
is sent to the display variable 'msg'

There is an example HMI file included.
Press on the MMDVM logo on the main screen to go to the 'system' page

The example has some other functions included:
Temperature, CPU load and CPU freq. displayed on the rest screen.
The load is also shown as a process bar on top of the screen, which
will change color when the load goes high (>0.80).

When using NextionDriver, you might want to choose layout 4 in the
MMDVM.ini file.
This way, the communication to the Nextion display will be at 112500bps
which will give a better display refresh speed when much of the data 
on the display changes.
