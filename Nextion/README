Nextion Display Layout for NextionDriver
========================================

There are some example HMI files included.
Please also read the other README files !


Even when using NextionDriver without modifications, you can make
a layout with buttons. Make the Touch Release Event with following code:

* when there is a command
    printh 2A
    printh F0
    printh <linux command>
    printh FF
    printh FF
    printh FF

the 'linux command' is executed
This could be, for example, 'service mmdvmhost stop' or 'service mmdvmhost start'


* When there is a command
    printh 2A
    printh F1
    printh <linux command>
    printh FF
    printh FF
    printh FF

the 'linux command' is executed and the __FIRST__ line of the result
is sent to the display variable 'msg'
