Nextion Display Layout for NextionDriver
========================================

The NextionDriver intoduces some supplementary fiels for linux hosts
(as most hotspots are)

It is advisable to switch to layout 4, setting your display baudrate to 115200bps
If not, screen updates wil be rather slow...

I know, the example display in this directory is not a nice, beautiful layout.
It is a basic layout to show the possibilities.
Making someting nice of it is your job ;-)
